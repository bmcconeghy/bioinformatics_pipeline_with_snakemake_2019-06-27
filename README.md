# Building a bioinformatics pipeline with snakemake
Introduction to snakemake for processing biological sequencing data.
## About the lesson
This course is an introduction to using the Snakemake workflow management system to create reproducible and scalable bioinformatics pipelines. Workflows are written in Python and can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition. In this course, we will be writing a Snakemake pipeline that takes DNA reads as input and runs basic QC on them, maps them to a genome of interest, sorts them, indexes them, and calls genomic variants.
